## Background

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Observable Trends

* There are more males than females in the game but gender has little influence on how much each player spends. The percentage of sex is very close to percentage of total purchase.
* The main target range for the age of players is between 15-29 with the vast majority between 20-24.  Younger and older players (outside of the target range) are still purchasing close to the average person expenditure. 
* Players are more likely to purchase at least one item. Only three players purchased more than three items.
